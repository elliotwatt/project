Introduction
</h2>

Dynamic portfolio and stock analysis tools are indispensable for investors, traders, and financial professionals. This proposal outlines the development of a portfolio and stock analysis software that provides powerful tools to analyze investments. The software will enable users to calculate cumulative returns, beta, correlation, covariance, variance, and other essential financial metrics. Additionally, it will offer the flexibility to incorporate user inputs and access external data through APIs. To optimize data visualization, the software will leverage PyViz for creating interactive plots. In project two, we aim to integrate the software into a website, making it accessible to a broader audience.
